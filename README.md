## Introduction

The User Management API is designed to handle user-related operations, including user registration, login, profile management, and CRUD operations on user data. The API is built with Node.js and Express, with MongoDB as the database.

## Features

- User registration and authentication
- Create, read, update, and delete user information
- Secure password hashing
- JWT-based authentication

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muhammadmaarij/User-Management-Api.git
cd User-Management-Api
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables:

```
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
PORT=5000
```

4. **Run the application:**

```bash
npm start
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

Use tools like Postman or cURL to interact with the API. The base URL for the API is `http://localhost:5000`.
